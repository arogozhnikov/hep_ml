### Main features

* uniform classifiers - the classifiers with low correlation of predictions and mass (or some other variable, or even set of variables)
  * __uBoost__ optimized implementation inside
  * __UGradientBoosting__ (with different losses, specially __FlatnessLoss__ is of high interest)
* measures of uniformity (see **hep_ml.metrics**)
* advanced losses for classification, regression and ranking for __UGradientBoosting__ (see **hep_ml.losses**).  
* **hep_ml.nnet** - theano-based flexible neural networks 
* **hep_ml.reweight** - reweighting multidimensional distributions <br />
  (_multi_ here means 2, 3, 5 and more dimensions - see GBReweighter!)
* **hep_ml.splot** - minimalistic sPlot-ting 
* **hep_ml.speedup** - building models for fast classification (Bonsai BDT)
* **sklearn**-compatibility of estimators.

### Installation

Plain and simple:

```bash
pip install hep_ml
```

If you're new to python and never used `pip`, first install scikit-learn [with these instructions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).

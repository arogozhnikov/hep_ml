"""
**sPlot** is reweighting technique frequently used in HEP to reconstruct the distributions of features in mixture.
Initial information used is the probabilities obtained after fitting.

**hep_ml.splot** contains standalone python implementation of this technique.
This implementation is brilliantly simple and clear - just as it should be.

Example
-------

>>> from hep_ml.splot import compute_sweights
>>> p = pandas.DataFrame({'signal': p_signal, 'bkg', b_bkg})
>>> sWeights = compute_sweights(p)
>>> # plotting reconstructed distribution of some other variable
>>> plt.hist(other_var, weights=sWeights.signal)
>>> plt.hist(other_var, weights=sWeights.bkg)

For more examples and explanations, see notebooks/Splot in repository.
